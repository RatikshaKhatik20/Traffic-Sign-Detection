# Traffic-Sign-Detection
DESCRIPTION:
It is a project of traffic sign detection and classification.This system on videos using opencv.Dataset part is contains images of different traffic signs and The detection part uses Image Processing techniques that create outline on each video frame and find all ellipses or circles among those outline.and they are detect and marked as traffic sign.
In classification part a list of images are created by cropping from the original frame based on candidates' coordinate. A pre-trained SVM model will classify these images to find out which type of traffic sign they are.
Traffic Sign images:
